Welcome to the documentation page of 3D Survey Collection (3DSC)
===========================================================================

**3D Survey Collection** is an open-source add-on for Blender, coded in Python, that simplifies the process of transforming large architectural complexes or archaeological sites datasets, acquired with laser scanner or photogrammetry, into reusable assets for online/offline publication in virtual museums or applied games. 3DSC is an add-on that allows to widely manage 2D and 3D survey data within the 3D environment of Blender. The add-on is suitable for users (such as: archaeologist, architects, engineers, etc) who work with 3D meshes (such as: photogrammetric models) and need to manage, visualize and edit all this information within the same space.

This add-on is a significant digital tool included within the `Extended Matrix Framework <https://www.extendedmatrix.org/discover/emf>`_, an Open Source and Open Science project which has been developed to manage, visualize, represent and share data and paradata associated to the documentation and the reconstruction of an archaeological context, an object or a collection. 

3DSC allows to:  

- import/export 2D, 3D objects and cameras 

- segment objects in tiles 

- create and manage objects with Level Of Details (LODs) 

- edit color and texture 

- etc ... 

The add-on has been developed by E. Demetrescu at CNR-ISPC (Rome, former CNR-ITABC).


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for information about the installation of the add-on.
